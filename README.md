# Pseudo Random Number Generator using Weather Data
This project implements a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) that uses weather data as a source of entropy. The generator is based on the average of hourly weather forecast data, which is then used as a seed for a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) to produce a sequence of random numbers.

# Notice that random numbers generated by this project are not cryptographically secure and may not be suitable for all applications. Use at your own risk.

# To build the project

```bash
make build
```

# To test the project
```bash
make test
```

# To generate random numbers between 0 and 1, run the main.py script with the desired number of random numbers as an argument. For example, to generate 3 random numbers:

```bash
python src/generator/main.py 3
```
